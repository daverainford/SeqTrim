# SeqTrim
SeqTrim is a fast and streamlined function to trim low-quality bases and remove adaptor sequences. It is built in Python and, depending on your computers performance metrics, a ~4GB FASTQ file takes ~13 minutes to trim.

It takes five inputs: the path to the folder containing your fastq files, a path for the trimmed file, your adaptor sequence, the minimum read length you deem acceptable, and the minimum quality score you deem acceptable.
